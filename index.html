    <!-- <style type="text/css">@import("path/to.css")</style> could be used instead of the link tag. the link tag can be used wthout the 'type' attribute, and the result would be the same in html5 as html5 usually supports css. the second link tag is an alternate stylesheet. some browsers allow this to be applied and can be toggled in the settings. type should be changed to "image/x-icon" if used with a .ico file. a file named favicon.ico at the root of your website will typically be loaded and applied automatically, without theneed for a <link> tag. If this file ever changes, browsers can be slow and stubborn about updating their cache. -->
